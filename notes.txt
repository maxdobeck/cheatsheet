# sftp
https://www.computerhope.com/unix/sftp.htm

sftp user@host:targetDir/target.zip /Downloads

# drives
Where is that god dang drive? How big is it? What the hell do I mount?
lsblk 
(list block devices)
df -TH 
(H flag makes it human readable)

mounting (simple)
sudo mount /dev/your_drive /home/a_user/some/place
-t if you have to specify 
the device's type.  FAT, etc
Mount just takes a device's file structure and attaches it to your local file tree. You get to pick the name/place where it is attached and accessible.

mounting (oh shit, something went wrong)
something didn't work?
- dmesg (any bad juju from the kernel gets picked up here)
- lsblk to confirm you have the right device.  Triple check
- df -TH to again confirm, check the FREE SPACE is what you expect
mess with lsblk & df as needed
- mount (to see what's current. lots of output, maybe not useful)

unmount and remove drive
sudo umount /dir/you/mounted
