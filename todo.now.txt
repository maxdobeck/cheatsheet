Backup some files 

TOML config
backup: CSV list of files/dirs to backup.  Assume you referring to the home directory if full path is not present.

exclude: path to exlusion `.txt` file.  blacklist of things to ignore, passed directly to tar. Can generate this file with popular options (basically .gitignore on github)

dest-ip: ip address for destination to move to

dest-s3: s3 type auth.

dest-local: full path to destination on current machine

### Execution Steps
1. compress the target files
2. generate checksum from step 1 output
3. compare checksum against destination (if any old backups exist)
4. replace any if the checksums don't match
