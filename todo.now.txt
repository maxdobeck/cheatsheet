# bup
command-line-utilities, filesystem
Backup some files with plain old tar, restore some files from backup. Tar is a dependency.

TOML config
backup: CSV list of full path to file or dir.  ASSUMING you are in the `~` home directory if full path not present.
exclude: path to exlusion `.txt` file.  blacklist of things to ignore, passed directly to tar. Can generate this file with popular options (basically .gitignore on github)
dest-ip: ip address for destination to move to
dest-s3: s3 type auth.
dest-local: full path to destination on current machine

### Execuation steps
1. tar the target files
2. generate checksum from step 1 output
3. compare checksum against dest
4. replace any tarballs if the checksums don't match
